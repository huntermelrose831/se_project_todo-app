# Simple Todo App

This project is a simple and responsive To-Do App built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed, providing a clean and intuitive interface to manage daily tasks efficiently.

## Functionality

This To-Do App is a web-based task management application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of the project is to provide users with a lightweight and easy-to-use tool for organizing their tasks and staying productive.

Core Features:
Task Creation:

Users can add new tasks by typing into an input field and pressing an "Add" button or hitting Enter.

Each task is displayed as a list item in the main task list area.

Task Completion:

Clicking on a task (or a checkbox next to it) will mark it as completed.

Completed tasks may be styled differently (e.g., with a line-through effect or faded color) to visually separate them from active tasks.

Task Deletion:

Each task includes a delete button (such as an "X" or trash icon) that allows the user to remove it from the list.

Persistent Data (Optional if implemented):

The app may use LocalStorage to save tasks so they remain even after the page is refreshed or the browser is closed and reopened.

Responsive Design:

The layout adapts to different screen sizes, making the app usable on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technology

1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
   Purpose: Provides the structure and content of the app.

Usage:

Defines the input field for adding tasks.

Structures the task list container.

Adds buttons and icons for task management (add, complete, delete).

2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
   Purpose: Styles and formats the user interface for visual appeal and responsiveness.

Techniques Used:

Flexbox for layout alignment and spacing.

Custom styling for completed vs. active tasks.

Media queries for making the layout mobile-friendly.

Hover effects and transitions for interactivity.

3. JavaScript
   Purpose: Adds dynamic functionality and interactivity.

Techniques Used:

DOM Manipulation: Dynamically creates, updates, and removes task elements.

Event Listeners: Detects clicks, form submissions, and user input.

LocalStorage (if implemented): Saves tasks locally in the browser so that they persist on page reload.
